    "## Problem Statement (200 words maximum)\n",
    "In liquid-fuel rocket engines, a critical design consideration is the temperature of the combustion chamber walls, as the heat generated by fuel combustion can melt through the chamber walls if they are thermally unregulated. A common solution is regenerative cooling, where some fuel is pumped into the combustion chamber through holes in the chamber walls called cooling channels, absorbing heat from the combustion chamber walls en route to the combustion chamber. This simultaneously regulates the chamber wall temperature and makes the combustion process more efficient.\n",
    "Design a regenerative cooling circuit for an idealized liquid-fuel rocket engine, such that appropriate thrust can be generated in the combustion chamber while the steady-state wall temperature is below the melting temperature of your material of choice. Assume that the working fluid is ethanol, and that fuel must enter the combustion chamber in the liquid phase."

    "## Background information and Summary (250 words maximum)\n",
    "Rocket engines, especially those using liquid fuel, generate high temperatures due to the combustion of fuel and oxidizer. In a typical liquid-fueled rocket engine, the temperatures in the combustion chamber can exceed 3,000 Kelvin. Without proper cooling, the engine parts could completely melt causing an explosion and/or rocket faliure. This could put astronauts and others on the aircraft in fatal danger, so it is extremely important to make sure the rocket engines are able to withstand extremely high temperatures.\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the most important applications of liquid cooling is in the walls of the combustion chamber and the nozzle throat. These areas experience the highest thermal stress because they are directly exposed to the hot gases produced by the fuel-oxidizer reaction. The engine walls are often lined with a network of coolant passages, to avoid any structural failure. As the liquid fuel moves around the coolant passages, it absorbs heat from its surroundings and takes it away from the combustion chamber. This prevents the walls of the combustion chamber from reaching dangerously high temperatures.\n",
    "\n",
    "Liquid cooling allows rocket engines to operate at higher performance levels, pushing the limits of temperature and pressure without putting any of the hardware at structural risk. By managing heat super efficiently, engineers can design engines that produce more thrust and reduce the risk of overheating by a large amount. This is particularly important for achieving higher specific impulse (a measure of engine efficiency) and overall engine performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "Regulating the temperature in the chamber walls and improving the efficiency of the combustion process will ensure the structural safety of the rocket. Even more importantly, it will make sure those on board the rocket will be in a safe environment. The reliability and performance of the rocket will be majorly improved, and improving efficiency will also reduce overall costs for projects such as these."

    "A double-pass cooling system would be a good way to improve the cooling in the rocket combustion engine in comparison to a single-pass system. Splitting the total heat removal of an estimated 1000 kW into two 500 kW stages creates more uniform cooling in the engine and reduces thermal stress on the chamber walls. Our calculations show that the double-pass system has a significantly higher Coefficient of Performance (COP of 12.24 versus 5.88), indicating it removes heat more efficiently for the same work input. Additionally, our exergy analysis demonstrates that using smaller temperature differences in each pass reduces irreversibilities in the system. A double-pass cooling system, though, is more expensive than a single-pass one. There is more complexity in a double-pass cooling system, and more components are required to support such a process. However, since a double-pass system can offer better heat exchange efficiency and cooling performance, we beleive the higher cost is justifyable.\n",

The values may be a bit off, but we can assume there will be a clear improvement in efficiency between the single- and double-pass cooling systems."
